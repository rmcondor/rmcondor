### Hi there. I'm Ronny ðŸ‘‹

### About me
Iâ€™m a Master Candidate in Economics at Universidad de San AndrÃ©s (UdeSA). I also hold a bachelor's degree in economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM). Currently, I am a research assistant at the London School of Economics, working on a project that might help to understand trends in the use of time using microdata around the world. Additionally, I am working with Diego Marino (Durham University) on a project that tries to understand the motivated reasoning behind forecasts in economic indicators in Argentina. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), where I managed field experiments on early childhood development, entrepreneurial mindset, and gender gaps in STEM. Before joining IPA, I worked as a consultant at the Office of the Comptroller General of Peru on a project related to public management control services in cooperation with the IDB.

My main fields of research interest are development economics and political economy.
